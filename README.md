## Description

React application that displays non-sensitive employee information in a simple layout. employees can sort the page by the name of employees and filter by the employee names as well to quickly locate specific employees available. 

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Installation 
npm install 
npm start 

## Plans for Future Development 

Have the ability to add employees, delete employees, and edit employee information within the application. Also include more options for users to sort and filter by.
